Description of remote camera overlay components:

The designer may specify any number of "smudges" and "chips", that
get rendered after the 3d scene is rendered, and before the
inventory graphics.

Smudges are textures, which may be transparent or alpha textures.
Alpha textures are monochromatic, using just the first 16 palette
entries to specify alpha level. Each smudge defines an AlphaLevel
(0 to 1), a color (rgb, 0-1 each), a size scale (xy, 0-1 each),
a position (xy, 0-1 each), and a rotation angle (in degrees).

Chips are rendered much as the FU raindrops were. They pretend to
refract light. They are defined by giving their position on the
screen (xy, 0-1 each), and their profile id, which is a number that
defines the shape of the chip. The chips are based on a circular
shape. Profiles 0-7 specify 1/8 wedges of that circle, starting
at the 12:00 position, and working clockwise. Profiles 9-15 specify
1/4 wedges, in 1/8 increments; 16-23 specify 1/2 wedges, in 1/8
increments. Profile 24 is the whole circle. The full circle has a
diameter of 16 pixels.

'Xmudge' with 'Smudge' and 'Xhip' with 'Chip', to enable the various
elements.
